# Hi!

I am currently an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Mathematics](https://maths.iiserb.ac.in) at [Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Bhopal](https://www.iiserb.ac.in). Before coming to IISERB, from 2021 to 2024, I was a Coleman Post Doctoral Fellow in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at [Queen's University, Canada](https://www.queensu.ca/mathstat/), working in the research group of [Prof. Serdar Yuksel](https://mast.queensu.ca/~yuksel/). Before that, from 2019 to 2021, I was a National Post Doctoral Fellow at the Department of Mathematics, [Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Pune](https://www.iiserpune.ac.in/research/department/mathematics), India, working in the research group of [Prof. Anup Biswas](https://sites.google.com/view/anupbiswas/home).

I obtained my integrated Ph.D. degree from the Department of Mathematics, [Indian Institute of Science](https://math.iisc.ac.in//index.html), Bangalore, India in 2019 under the supervision of [Prof. Mrinal Kanti Ghosh](https://math.iisc.ac.in/~mkg/index.html).

# Research interests
